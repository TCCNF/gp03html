        <h1>Metaverse</h1>
        <p>
          The Metaverse is a digital realm where individuals can interact with
          each other and the virtual environment simultaneously. <br />It's a
          concept that involves a communal virtual space where people can live,
          work, and indulge in leisure activities in a three-dimensional domain
          without physical boundaries.

        <h3>Business</h3>
        <p>
          The Metaverse can provide new opportunities for entrepreneurship and
          <br />employment, as virtual goods and services become more prevalent.
          <br />It can also create new industries, such as virtual real estate
          <br />and advertising.

      <div class="background-col">
        <h3>Social</h3>
        <p>
          The Metaverse can provide people with a sense of community and social
          <br />connection, especially for those who may feel isolated or
          marginalized <br />in the physical world. It can also facilitate
          cross-cultural <br />communication and understanding, bringing people
          from different <br />backgrounds and geographic locations together.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="background-col">
        <h3>Safety</h3>
        <p>
          The Metaverse can also present risks of exploitation and surveillance,
          <br />as personal data and virtual assets are stored and tracked.
          There are <br />concerns about how companies and governments will use
          this data, and <br />how it could be exploited for profit or control.

            <h3>About Blockchain</h3>
            <p>
              Blockchain is a digital ledger technology <br />that is
              decentralized and securely records and stores information in a
              transparent manner.

      <h1>Non-Fungible Token (NFT)</h1>
      <p>
        NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are a class of digital assets that utilize
        blockchain technology to authenticate their ownership and
        distinctiveness. <br />cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are
        interchangeable and hold equal value, NFTs are one-of-a-kind and
        non-transferable, <br />making them highly valuable as collectibles.
      </p>

          <h3>Empowerment of artists</h3>
          <p>
            NFTs provide a new way for artists to monetize their work and
            receive a fair share of the profits. With traditional art sales,
            artists may only receive a small percentage of the sale price, while
            galleries and other middlemen take the lion's share. With NFTs,
            artists can sell their work directly to buyers and retain a larger
            percentage of the profits.
          </p>

          <h3>Changes to the art market</h3>
          <p>
            The traditional art market is known for being exclusive and
            difficult to access for many artists and buyers. NFTs have the
            potential to democratize the art market by providing a new avenue
            for artists to sell their work and for buyers to discover new
            artists.

        </div>

        <div class="effect-col">

          <h3>New forms of ownership</h3>
          <p>
            NFTs could lead to new forms of ownership for digital assets. For
            example, a group of people could come together to purchase an NFT
            representing a piece of digital art, with each person owning a
            fraction of the asset. This could make it easier for people to
            invest in and share ownership of digital assets.
